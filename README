# LED-Blinking-8051-Microcontroller

Steps to write the Program

Firstly you have to select the port pin for led.
You have to configure the pin as an output to write the first value 0.
Now pin configured as the output, if you have passed 1 or 0 on that pin it will directly reflect on it.

Here I am describing some method to write a led toggling program
Method 1

In this method, we use the sbit (single bit) keyword to select the port pin. It allows accessing of a single bit of an SFR register.

Syntax to use sbit
sbit   Any_Name  =   Px^y;


x is port 0,1,2 or 3.
y is pin o,1,..7.
